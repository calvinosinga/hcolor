Galaxy auto powers in redshift space at $z = 0$, projecting velocities along different lines of sight. Each line of sight is plotted as a ratio over the fiducial $x$-axis. It is not necessarily expected that each line of sight gives similar power spectra, as some axes will collapse faster than others (Zel'dovich pancake). In any case, the auto powers change by a factor of about 1.3 on the largest scales, so the effect is not large.
