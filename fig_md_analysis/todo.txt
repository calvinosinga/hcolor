make plot showing how using just stellar mass of galaxies affects the power spectrum

compute the bias of the galaxy + ptl and HI + ptl, and galaxy + HI

remake the HI_slices figure using new figlib object

make plots using CIC binning procedure

Remake HIXGalaxy plots - reorder them and compute the color ratio in addition to the RSD
- also need to combine hisubhalo in the real space panel

Make ptl auto power plots

Make Pk_demo plots/animation/tool

Make los test plots for galaxy_dust

make los test plots for redshift space power spectra

make colordef test plots

remake galaxy + HI thresholds plots

remake color-stmass histogram

remake galaxy + HI bins plots

remake galaxyXHI but with the galaxy part binned

make power spectrum plots testing using no resolution limit on galaxies.
