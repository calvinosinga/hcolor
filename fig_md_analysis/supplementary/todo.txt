redshift evolution of HI auto power spectra

redshift evolution of stellar mass/HI halo mass bins if we decide to remove them

MAS analysis results

Why we went only until z = 1

gr-stmass of dust

gr-stmass of centrals and satellites separately

whether star-forming vs quiescent or red vs blue distinction is important

difference between theoretical and observationally defined biases
